## Allolib playground & Evan Nguyen S22
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib_playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib_playground)

Please see the original repository, found here: https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib_playground

This repository contains several branches that I will progressively publish to main, since I like compartmentalizing my work.
# localpython 
This is my main project. This uses a UDP server from allolib (with courtesy of Lance Putnam, 2014) combined with a UDP client on python - by me. The goal here is to bridge the gap between more complex apps that are more suitably ran on python, to still interact within a c++ allolib environment. The project itself is an attempt at hand-controlled/gesture instrumentals, which will give the user full control through hand motion alone (webcam needed).

# bazel 
Initial tests in C++ to import mediapipe through bazel. It successfully compiles and all the windows build commandlines (which were modified for my system), can be found in log.txt.
